## About Me

My name is Mr. Raphepela TJ. Growing up in front of a computer, I've always been fascinated by the world of technology. Now, as a second-year student pursuing a BSc in Information Technology, I am focused on building a career in cybersecurity. My journey has been driven by a passion for protecting digital landscapes and ensuring the safety of online communities.

Another thing is that I am a gamer! ðŸ˜Š Check my YouTube handle below on the links. ðŸ¤™
